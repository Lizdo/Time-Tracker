#Minimal Time Tracker

I was trying to find a simple time tracker the other day to calculate the time I spent on my pet projects, and found that all of them require some kind of backend subscription service. What I wanted was really simple so I just wrote my own.

You can download it [here](https://raw.github.com/Lizdo/Time-Tracker/master/Export/TimeTracker.zip). It's not code signed so probably you need to **right click** on the app and select **Open** to bypass the Gatekeeper.
